  <h1>Fifa world cup 2018</h1>
<div>
  <p>The <b>2018 FIFA World Cup</b> was <b>the 21st FIFA World Cup</b>, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Russia from <b>14 June</b> to <b>15 July 2018</b>, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in <b>2010</b>. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over <b>$14.2 billion,</b> it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the <b>2022 World Cup</b> in Qatar.The tournament phase involved <b>32 teams</b>, of which <b>31</b> came through qualifying competitions, while as the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the <b>32</b>, <b>20</b> had also appeared in the <b>2014</b> event, while Iceland and Panama each made their first appearance at the World Cup. <b>64 matches</b> were played in 12 venues across <b>11</b> cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since <b>1938</b>. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on <b>15 July</b> at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match <b>4–2</b>, claiming their second World Cup.

Croatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. England's Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six. Belgium's Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance. It has been estimated that more than <b>3 million people</b> attended games during the tournament.</p>

  <h1>host selection</h1>
<p>
  The bidding procedure to host the <b>2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments </b>began in <b>january 2009,</b> and national associations had until <b> February 2009 </b>to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the <b>2018 FIFA World Cup,</b> but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings,and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in <b>february 2010 </b>after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus were ruled out of the <b>2022 bid.</b> As such, there were eventually four bids for the <b>2018 FIFA World Cup,</b> two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.

The <b>22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010</b> to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments. Russia won the right to be the<b> 2018 host</b> in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.

  <p>The choice of Russia as host was controversial. Issues included the level of racism in Russian football,human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea. In <b>2014</b>, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that "the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work".

Russia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns. On <b>May 2017, FIFA</b> president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg's Zenit Arena. By <b>June 2017</b>, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers’ International. In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.

Allegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for <b>the 2018 and 2022 World Cups</b> led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win. FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash. Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup. Garcia criticised the summary as being "materially incomplete" with "erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee. The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a "lack of leadership" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence.

On <b>3 June 2015</b>, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and <b>2022 World Cups</b>. In an interview published on <b>7 June 2015</b>, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that "should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled". Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the <b>2018 World Cup in England</b> was discussed.</p>
